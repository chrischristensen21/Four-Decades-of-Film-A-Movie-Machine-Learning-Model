## Background

For this project we created a [website] (https://moviemodel.herokuapp.com/m) that contains over 40 years of movie data to explore and also contains a machine learing model that allows users to predict the gross earnings of a hypothetical movie scenarios based on the writer, star actor, genre, budget and runtime. There are 6 section the user can scroll through which are as follows: About, Model, Director, Movie, Star, and Creators.

**About Section** an explanation of the project.
